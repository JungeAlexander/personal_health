## Setup

### Personal access token

To access your Oura data programmatically, you will need a [personal access token](https://cloud.ouraring.com/v2/docs#section/Data-Access).
My code assumes that your token in a `.env` file in the base directory of this repository which looks like this:

```
OURA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```

### Development setup

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) which, once you have it [installed](https://pre-commit.com/#install),
can be configured as follows:

```shell
pre-commit install
```
